# BenBot

BenBot is a JavaFX personal-assistant chatbot for tasks, contacts, notes, and
expenses. Type commands in its conversation window to organize your information
and save it between sessions.

## Features

- Create to-dos, deadlines, and events with dates and optional times.
- List tasks, search their descriptions, mark them done or not done, and delete
  them by number.
- Add, list, and delete contacts with names, phone numbers, and email addresses.
- Record, list, and delete short text notes.
- Track expenses, list their total, and delete individual entries. Amounts use
  exact decimal arithmetic and display with two decimal places.
- Keep separate numbered lists for tasks, contacts, notes, and expenses.
- Save all four lists on `bye` or when the JavaFX window closes, and reload them
  at startup.

## Run BenBot

Use **JDK 25**. From the project root on macOS or Linux, run:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

On Windows Command Prompt, use:

```bat
gradlew.bat run
```

The Gradle task opens BenBot's JavaFX window. Enter a command in the text field
and press Enter or select **Send**.

## Commands

Use lowercase command words and replace uppercase placeholders with your own
values. Square brackets indicate optional input; do not type the brackets.
Enter one command per line.

### Tasks

| Command | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `todo DESCRIPTION` | Add a to-do | `todo read book` |
| `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE [TIME]` | Add a deadline | `deadline submit report /by 15/9/2026 1800` |
| `event DESCRIPTION /from START /to END` | Add an event | `event team meeting /from 15/9/2026 1400 /to 15/9/2026 1600` |
| `list` | Show all tasks | `list` |
| `find KEYWORD` | Search task descriptions, ignoring case | `find book` |
| `mark TASK_NUMBER` | Mark a task as done | `mark 2` |
| `unmark TASK_NUMBER` | Mark a task as not done | `unmark 2` |
| `delete TASK_NUMBER` | Delete a task | `delete 2` |

Dates use `day/month/year`, such as `15/9/2026`. Optional times use the 24-hour
`HHmm` format, such as `1800`. Each event boundary (`START` and `END`) accepts a
date with an optional time; the end must not precede the start.

BenBot stores up to 100 tasks. `find` matches text anywhere in a task description
and keeps the original task numbers in its results. It searches tasks only.

### Contacts

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `contact NAME /phone PHONE /email EMAIL` | Add a contact |
| `contacts` | Show all contacts |
| `delete-contact CONTACT_NUMBER` | Delete a contact |

For example:

```text
contact Alice Tan /phone 91234567 /email alice@example.com
contacts
delete-contact 1
```

All three fields are required, with `/phone` before `/email`. Names can contain
spaces; phone numbers and email addresses must each be a single value without
spaces.

### Notes

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `note TEXT` | Record a nonempty text note |
| `notes` | Show all notes |
| `delete-note NOTE_NUMBER` | Delete a note |

For example:

```text
note Watch Arrival
notes
delete-note 1
```

Notes may contain multiple words. Whitespace between words is normalized to
single spaces.

### Expenses

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `expense DESCRIPTION /amount AMOUNT` | Add an expense |
| `expenses` | Show all expenses and their total |
| `delete-expense EXPENSE_NUMBER` | Delete an expense |

For example:

```text
expense bus fare /amount 2.40
expenses
delete-expense 1
```

Use a positive amount such as `2.40`, without a currency symbol. Amounts must be
representable exactly with two decimal places; BenBot does not round fractional
cents. Expense displays and totals use `$`, with no currency conversion.

### Numbers and saving

Each list starts at 1. Use the number shown by `list`, `contacts`, `notes`, or
`expenses` with the corresponding command. Deleting an entry renumbers later
entries in that list. Task completion commands apply only to tasks.

Use `bye` to save all data and exit. Closing the JavaFX window also saves the
data. Changes are saved at exit, rather than after each command.

All lists are stored in `data/stored-task` relative to the directory from which
BenBot is launched. Start BenBot from the same directory to reload the same
data. Task completion status is preserved too.

## Set up IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open the repository as a project in a recent IntelliJ IDEA version.
2. Configure the project SDK and Gradle JVM as JDK 25, with the project language
   level set to `SDK default`.
3. Allow Gradle to finish importing the project.
4. Run the `run` Gradle task, or run `benbot.Launcher.main()`.

Keep `src/main/java` as the source root so Gradle and IntelliJ IDEA can locate
the Java source files.

## Test and check the project

Run the tests and Checkstyle checks with JDK 25:

```bash
./gradlew check
```

GitHub Actions runs the same checks on Linux, macOS, and Windows for pushes and
pull requests. On Windows Command Prompt, replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat`.

## Build the executable JAR

Create the JAR containing BenBot and its dependencies with:

```bash
./gradlew shadowJar
```

The generated file is `build/libs/benbot.jar`. With Java 25, start it using:

```bash
java -jar build/libs/benbot.jar
```
